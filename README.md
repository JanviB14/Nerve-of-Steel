# Nerve of Steel game
### MGTC28 practice using github
This is a game written in Python  

Nerve_of_steel.py is a simple game, its objective is to act as a timer for the players. It starts by asking the players to stand, followed by a 5-25-second lag for players to sit. It then displays a message indicating that time's up and the winning player is the one who is last seated.
timer.py uses the time library to help keep track of time along with the random library to randomize the amount of time for the timer to sleep. The pillow library allows the  times-up message to be displayed as a picture.
